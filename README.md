This project is intended to familiarize with webpack, json, and bundling as a whole. For the sake of time, new images have not been selected for the mobile menu, and menu images have had their display set to "none". This is because all my images are vertical and don't effectively compliment the mobile layout.

The scheduling parameters do not take realistic time units into account. I will revist scheduling when I undergo the Node section of the course.
